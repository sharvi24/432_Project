# Bucketing & Ensembling to Classify Hand Gestures in Sign Language to English letters

The objective was to correctly identify American Sign Language (ASL) signs that correspond to the hand gestures represented by English alphabets. The project compares and contrasts the performance of different machine learning models for the given multi-label classification task. 

The proposed approach of combining similar-looking hand gesture labels into a combined label and then classifying them back into individual labels from those combined labels reduced the misclassification rates of similar hand gesture labels and improved accuracy from 84.3% with single classifier to 86.4%.
Achieved on avg. 7.9 % reduction in misclassification rate per label for similar hand gesture signs.
